Answers to common questions about Moonshine Voice.

## General Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When should I choose Moonshine over Whisper?">
    **TL;DR** - When you're working with live speech.

    Moonshine is specifically optimized for real-time voice applications, while Whisper excels at batch processing. Here's why Moonshine is better for live speech:

    **1. Flexible Input Windows**
    - Whisper always operates on a 30-second input window, wasting computation on padding
    - Moonshine accepts any length of audio, spending compute only on actual speech
    - Result: Much lower latency on short phrases (most voice interfaces)

    **2. Caching for Streaming**
    - Whisper starts from scratch on every call, even for repeated audio
    - Moonshine caches encoding and decoder state, skipping redundant work
    - Result: Can provide updates while the user is still talking

    **3. Better Accuracy-to-Size Ratio**
    - Moonshine Medium Streaming: 6.65% WER, 245M parameters
    - Whisper Large v3: 7.44% WER, 1.5B parameters
    - Moonshine achieves higher accuracy with 6x fewer parameters

    **4. Speed Comparison**

    | Model | WER | Parameters | MacBook Pro | Linux x86 | Raspberry Pi 5 |
    |-------|-----|------------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
    | Moonshine Medium Streaming | 6.65% | 245M | 107ms | 269ms | 802ms |
    | Whisper Large v3 | 7.44% | 1.5B | 11,286ms | 16,919ms | N/A |
    | Moonshine Small Streaming | 7.84% | 123M | 73ms | 165ms | 527ms |
    | Whisper Small | 8.59% | 244M | 1940ms | 3,425ms | 10,397ms |

    **Choose Whisper if**: You're doing bulk offline processing with GPUs where throughput matters more than latency.

    **Choose Moonshine if**: You're building voice interfaces that need to respond quickly to users.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What languages does Moonshine support?">
    Moonshine Voice currently supports:

    - **English** (Tiny, Tiny Streaming, Base, Small Streaming, Medium Streaming)
    - **Arabic** (Base)
    - **Japanese** (Base)
    - **Korean** (Tiny)
    - **Mandarin Chinese** (Base)

## Technical Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I improve transcription accuracy?">
    **1. Use the Right Model**
    - Larger models = better accuracy
    - Language-specific models outperform multilingual models
    - Choose based on your accuracy vs. speed tradeoff

    **2. Optimize Audio Quality**
    - Use a good microphone
    - Minimize background noise
    - Test with `save_input_wav_path` option to verify audio quality

    **3. Adjust VAD Settings**
    ```python
    transcriber = Transcriber(
        model_path=model_path,
        model_arch=model_arch,
        options={
            "vad_threshold": "0.5",  # Lower = longer segments
            "vad_window_duration": "0.5",  # Smoothing window
        }
    )
    ```

    **4. For Non-Latin Languages**
    - Set `max_tokens_per_second` to 13.0 (default is 6.5)
    - This prevents false hallucination detection

    **5. Domain Customization**
    - For specialized vocabulary, consider [commercial fine-tuning](mailto:contact@moonshine.ai)

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between streaming and non-streaming models?">
    **Non-Streaming (Tiny, Base)**:
    - Process complete audio segments
    - Lower memory usage
    - Good for shorter phrases
    - Simpler architecture

    **Streaming (Tiny Streaming, Small Streaming, Medium Streaming)**:
    - Cache encoder output and decoder state
    - Process audio incrementally
    - Much lower latency for real-time use
    - Can update transcription while user is still speaking
    - Ideal for interactive applications

    **Recommendation**: Use streaming models for live voice interfaces.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I handle multiple audio sources?">
    Use **Streams** to process multiple inputs with a single transcriber:

    ```python
    transcriber = Transcriber(model_path=model_path, model_arch=model_arch)
    
    # Create separate streams
    mic_stream = transcriber.create_stream()
    system_audio_stream = transcriber.create_stream()
    
    # Each stream has its own transcript
    mic_stream.start()
    system_audio_stream.start()
    
    # Events are tagged with stream_handle
    def on_line_completed(event):
        if event.stream_handle == mic_stream.handle:
            print(f"Mic: {event.line.text}")
        elif event.stream_handle == system_audio_stream.handle:
            print(f"System: {event.line.text}")
    ```

    This shares model weights, reducing memory usage.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use Moonshine with a GPU or NPU?">
    Moonshine uses ONNX Runtime, which supports hardware acceleration:

    - **CPU**: Works out of the box (optimized for ARM and x86_64)
    - **GPU**: ONNX Runtime can use CUDA, DirectML, or CoreML
    - **NPU**: Some platforms support neural processing units

    However, the pre-built packages are optimized for CPU execution across all platforms. Moonshine is designed to be fast enough on CPU for real-time use.

    For custom GPU builds, you'll need to build ONNX Runtime with GPU support and link against it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I debug transcription issues?">
    **1. Enable Logging**
    ```python
    transcriber = Transcriber(
        model_path=model_path,
        model_arch=model_arch,
        options={
            "log_api_calls": "true",
            "log_output_text": "true",
            "log_ort_runs": "true",
        }
    )
    ```

    **2. Save Input Audio**
    ```python
    options={"save_input_wav_path": "/tmp/debug"}
    ```
    Listen to the saved WAV files to verify audio quality.

    **3. Check Audio Format**
    - Ensure audio is mono (not stereo)
    - Sample rate is handled automatically
    - Values should be in range [-1.0, 1.0]

    **4. Test with Known Audio**
    Use the included test file:
    ```python
    from moonshine_voice import get_assets_path, load_wav_file
    test_wav = os.path.join(get_assets_path(), "two_cities.wav")
    audio_data, sample_rate = load_wav_file(test_wav)
    ```

    See [Debugging Guide](/guides/debugging) for more details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the memory footprint?">
    Model sizes (quantized):

    - **Tiny**: ~26 MB (26M parameters)
    - **Tiny Streaming**: ~34 MB (34M parameters)
    - **Base**: ~58 MB (58M parameters)
    - **Small Streaming**: ~123 MB (123M parameters)
    - **Medium Streaming**: ~245 MB (245M parameters)

    Runtime memory:
    - Small overhead for audio buffers
    - Caching state for streaming models
    - Multiple streams share model weights

    All models are designed for edge devices with limited memory.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I handle microphone permissions?">
    Moonshine Voice doesn't handle permissions directly - that's platform-specific:

    **iOS**: Add to Info.plist:
    ```xml
    <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
    <string>We need microphone access to transcribe your speech</string>
    ```

    **Android**: Add to AndroidManifest.xml:
    ```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
    ```
    And request at runtime (see Android examples).

    **Web**: Use Web Audio API with `getUserMedia()`

    See platform examples in `/resources/examples` for complete implementations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use Moonshine with React Native or Flutter?">
    Yes, but you'll need to create bindings:

    **React Native**:
    - Create a native module wrapping the iOS/Android SDKs
    - Use bridge to communicate with JavaScript

    **Flutter**:
    - Create a plugin using platform channels
    - Call native iOS/Android code

    The community is working on official bindings for these platforms. [Join Discord](https://discord.gg/27qp9zSRXF) to collaborate or get updates.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I bundle models with my app?">
    **iOS/macOS**:
    1. Add model files to Xcode project
    2. Ensure they're in "Copy Bundle Resources"
    3. Access via `Bundle.main.url(forResource:withExtension:)`

    **Android**:
    1. Place models in `src/main/assets/`
    2. Access via `AssetManager`

    **Python**:
    - Models download to cache directory automatically
    - Set custom location with `MOONSHINE_VOICE_CACHE` environment variable

    See examples for complete implementations.
